# MATLAB NetCDF Tutorial

The repository contains basic Matlab tutorials on working with netcdf files. Gridded sea surface temperature data (https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v4.html) is used in the tutorial scripts. For plotting, m-map package (https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/mapug.html) is used.
